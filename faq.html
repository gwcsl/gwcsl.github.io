      <h1>FAQs- ElfCon</h1>

    <div style= "border:2px solid yellowgreen">
    <h3> 
        Where does it start, and how do I find the start point?
    </h3>
        <blockquote> The location will be disclosed a week before on this website and on Twitter (follow!) It‚Äôll be in Manhattan, but that‚Äôs all we can say for now *wink wink* *nudge nudge* *say no more*</blockquote>
    </div>
&nbsp;
    <div style= "border:2px solid yellowgreen">
    <h3>
        What is the route?
    </h3>
        <blockquote>‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not exactly how it works. ElfCon is an adventure, a way for you to explore and test your limits. Hopefully by coming you‚Äôre willing to embark on that adventure, even if that adventure does not follow a planned route. </blockquote>
        <blockquote>This being said, updates on where the majority of the group is will be updated on our social media (@officialelfcon on Twitter on Instagram).</blockquote>
    </div>
&nbsp;
    <div style= "border:2px solid yellowgreen">
    <h3>
        Who's in charge?
    </h3>
        <blockquote>Chief Elf.</blockquote>
    </div>
&nbsp;
    <div style= "border:2px solid yellowgreen">
    <h3>
        What time does it start?
    </h3>
        <blockquote>Meet up at the central location is at 11am and the hot cocoa crawl starts 12pm sharp. Arrive early so you can meet and play with other elves and admire their elf fantasticness!</blockquote>
    </div>
&nbsp;
    <div style= "border:2px solid yellowgreen">
    <h3>What time does it end?</h3>
    <blockquote>Most likely by 3, but whenever your belly is full (however definitely by dark because elves have bedtimes).</blockquote>
    </div>
&nbsp;
    <div style= "border:2px solid yellowgreen">
    <h3>Do I really need to wear a costume?</h3>
    <blockquote>...Yes. Preferably elf, but any type of costume is appreciated. Wear something green, blue, red or any color, as long as you look like an elf. Costumes are fun, even for parents, and c‚Äômon, you can do better than just a hat! Don‚Äôt want to dress like an elf? Okay, you and just you can dress like a giant cup of hot cocoa (or a marshmallow, because who doesn‚Äôt love a marshmallow on their hot cocoa?)</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Please do NOT dress as a Santa or wear any Santa-related costumes. ElfCon is NOT SantaCon. ElfCon is ElfCon. As in Elf, not Santa. Thanks for your support to keep the Elf in ElfCon.</blockquote>
